# Exploratory-analysis-

The objetive of this repository is to contain notebooks with exploratory analysis of various datasets 

In a exploratory analysis I like to include the following aspects:
* Loading data
* Data cleaning and Data preparation
* Join datasets
* Transformation
* Data Visualization
* Conclusions and storytelling from data

The notebooks can be loaded in a Google Colab environment (just click the link or button). In colab you can use a Jupyter Notebook on Google servers with libraries and good hardware specifications without installations.

The datasets will be available in another of my repositories to facilitate loading. The sources of the data are specified with their respective links and mentions.
Thanks for your data.

Get in touch with me for any suggestion or correction.


## Repository notebooks

### [Historical record of imports and exports of Colombia](https://github.com/jmelendezgeo/Exploratory-analysis-/blob/main/ImportExportColombia.ipynb)
In this notebook we will work mainly with a historical record de of imports and exports of Colombia between 1962 and 2015 extracted from [OEC: The Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://oec.world/)
Will associate the transactions with the respective products (p.e Coffee Extracts). Here our dataset has approximately one million entries. 



### [Energy Supply](https://github.com/jmelendezgeo/Exploratory-analysis-/blob/main/EnegySupply.ipynb)

The information contained mainly corresponds to the supply of energy and production of renewable electricity of [United nations](https://unstats.un.org) of 2013, from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) on the GDP of countries and finally from the [Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology](https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?category=2102).
